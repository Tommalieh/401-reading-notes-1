#### Linked List:
A Linked List is the connected Nodes as a sequense, and every Node is a reference the next Node in the sequence.
Types Of Linked List:
1. Singly Linked List:.
A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
2. Dobly Linked List:
A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

#### advantage of a linked list
In contrast to an array, which stores data contiguously in memory, a linked list can easily insert or remove nodes from the list without reorganization of the entire data structure.

#### What is the Node:
Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

#### Head:
is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

#### Traversal:
When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.

#### Big O:
The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.
