# SUMMARY 

## API Server
The API Server is a lightweight Web application that allows users to create and expose data APIs from data, without the need for custom development.

## Sub Documents in Mongoose 
In Mongoose, subdocuments are documents that are nested in other documents. You can spot a subdocument when a schema is nested in another schema.

#### There are two ways to create documents that contain subdocuments:
1. arrays of subdocuments.
2. single nested subdocuments.

## Joining Data/Documents in Mongo
NoSQL Databases don’t really join, and doing so generally is considered an anti-pattern. Ensure that you’re modeling things in the most logical way for this data store.
Using mongoose virtuals, you can define more sophisticated relationships between documents.
