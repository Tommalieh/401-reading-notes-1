# SUMMARY #

### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development ###
1. Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
1. TDD creates a detailed specification.
1.TDD reduces the time spent on rework.

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? ###
 The behavior I am noticing is that beforeEach and afterEach are run before/after every, it blocks in the current context and all nested contexts.

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development? ###
Big-time investment. For the simple case, you lose about 20% of the actual implementation, but for complicated cases, you lose much more.

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes? ###
The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type that can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

### Test Driven Development (TDD) ###
Is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, so its an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.
### this ###
The value of this is determined by how a function is called. It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.
### classes ###
Classes are "special functions", the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.
- Class declarations
- Class expressions
### OOP ###
Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
### Objects ###
Are complex and each object may contain any combination of the primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
And objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
### immutable state ###
Immutable data cannot change its structure or the data in it.
### prototype ###
Is a property can be used to add methods to existing constructors.
