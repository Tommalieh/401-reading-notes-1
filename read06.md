# SUMMARY #

### HTTP
The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless request-response application layer protocol. HTTP is used to build distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation for the world wide web. Applications built using HTTP subscribe to the client-server computing model. In the client-server computing model a host designed to provide a service is called a server. Clients are hosts that make requests to that service. 
The HTTP specification defines how requests and responses should be formatted, but not what a service should represent.

### HTTP Request
A HTTP/1.1 request is formatted in text and transferred using TCP. The first line of the request contains the METHOD, URL, and HTTP VERSION. The following lines are the request HEADERS.

### HTTP Response
A HTTP/1.1 response is also formatted in text and transferred using TCP. The first line of the response contains the HTTP VERSION, STATUS CODE, and STATUS MESSAGE. 

### Swagger
