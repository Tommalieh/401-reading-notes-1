# SUMMARY 

## Access Control (ACL)
- Limiting what actions a user can preform on a given resource is called Access Control. 
- Access Controls are the selective restriction of resources. Access Controls are implemented everywhere in computer systems. UNIX files have read, write, and execute permissions assigned to owners, groups, and everyone else. Websites have limited access to pages based on the credentials of a user. APIs restrict access to internal and external developers differently.

## A CMS might :
- Allow admin users to create categories, content, manage user accounts, and run reports.
- Allow editor users to create, edit and delete existing content, but not see or manage user accounts.
- Allow guest users to access (read) content.
- Allow user users (logged in users) to access (read) content and apply a thumbs-up/down to content, but not change the actual content.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization.
