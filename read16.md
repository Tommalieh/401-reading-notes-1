# SUMMARY

## Event-driven programming:

Event-driven programming with javascript is a useful way to create interactive websites.after the webpage has loaded the javascript program continues to run waiting for an event. If you connect this event to a javascript function then the function will run when the event occurs.
In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses),or messages from other programs.

#### Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

- An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
- A main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

###  EventEmitter:

 EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.
