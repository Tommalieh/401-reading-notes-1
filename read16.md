# SUMMARY

## Event-driven programming 
Event-driven programming with JavaScript is a useful way to create interactive websites. Typically, after the webpage has loaded the JavaScript program continues to run waiting for an event. If you connect this event to a JavaScript function then the function will run when the event occurs.

#### Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:
- An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
- A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

###  EventEmitter
 EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.
