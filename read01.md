# SUMMARY #
### Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser? ###
Running JavaScript outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

### What is the difference between a module and a package? ###
- A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file.
- A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.

### What does the node package manager do? ###
Node Package Manager (NPM) is a command-line tool that installs, updates, or uninstalls Node.js packages in your application. It is also an online repository for open-source Node.js packages. 

### Ecosystem ###
The JavaScript ecosystem is a collection of software packages, libraries, and other resources that facilitate development as they integrate with each other. Those tools are created by different developers and providers – for example, the React library is powered by Facebook, while the Angular framework was created by Google, and Vue.js was designed by an independent developer.

### Node.js ###
- Node.js is an open source server environment and it's free.
- Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.).
- Node.js uses JavaScript on the server.

### Node.js Module ###
Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

### Node.js Package ###
Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope. Also, each module can be placed in a separate .js file under a separate folder.

A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file. A package must contain a package.json file in order to be published to the npm registry. 

### npm ###
- npm is the world’s largest Software Registry, And it's **open-source** developers use npm to share software.
- Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

### V8 Engine ###
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

### Compiler vs Interpreter ###
Compiler and Interpreter are two different ways to execute a program written in a programming or scripting language. A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also refereed as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++.

An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab.
