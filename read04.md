### Why would a developer choose to make data models?

### What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
When we are building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality. The model must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources. Computer scientists often refer to these functions by the acronym CRUD. A model should have the ability to perform at most of these four functions in order to be complete. If an action cannot be described by one of these four operations, then it should potentially be a model of its own.

The CRUD paradigm is common in constructing web applications because it provides a memorable framework for reminding developers of how to construct full, usable models. 

### What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
MongoDB is used for non-relational database management systems, while PostgreSQL is used for the relational database management system.

### What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.


### Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
NoSQL databases are designed to expand horizontally and in Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

### Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
When compared against relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance, and their data model addresses several shortcomings of the relational model. The advantages of NoSQL include being able to handle: Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
NoSQL came along to handle the scale requirements as web apps and multi-tenant services were taking off. Given how hard the problems were to solve, it is understandable that these early attempts at dealing with scaling at the storage layer forced customers into a difficult set of trade-offs.  
But relational databases have evolved. They can handle nearly all of the workloads, with the scalability, reliability, and availability requirements that modern applications demand.
