### JSON Web Token
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

### Okta’s Sign-in Widget
Okta’s Sign-in Widget is a JavaScript library that gives you a full-featured and customizable login widget that can be added to any website. With just a few lines of code, you can implement a login flow to your app.

### Cryptography
Cryptography is the science which studies methods for encoding messages so that they can be read only by a person who knows the secret information required for decoding, called the key; it includes cryptanalysis, the science of decoding encrypted messages without possessing the proper key, and has several other branches.

### Hash Algorithms
A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to reverse. If identical data is passed into the algorithm the same hash will always be produced. Hash algorithms are often used for checking the integrity of data.
