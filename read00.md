## How to Solve Programming Problems ##

**From the first article I read it**, I understood that I should go throw a set of steps to solve any programming problem.
*First of all*, Read the problem completely twice(you must understand the problem before you do anything), then try to solve the problem manually and optimize your manual steps.
*also*, They prefer to write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code and after that, you can replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
*Finally*, Optimize the real code.

*You teach people how to treat you.*
