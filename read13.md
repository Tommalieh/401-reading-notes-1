# SUMMARY

## Bearer Authorization  
Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

## JSON Web Tokens(JWT)  
  -  is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties (servers, clients, etc) as a JSON object.  
  - This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed  
  - JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.  
  -  JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties  

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?  
 1. Authorization  
   -  the most common scenario for using JWT
   - Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT  
   - allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token  
 2. Information Exchange  
   - JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties;Because JWTs can be signed.
